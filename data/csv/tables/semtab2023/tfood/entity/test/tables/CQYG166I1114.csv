Prop11,"What swallow goes best with efo riro? Efo can be paired with Nigerian swallows like eba, fufu, amala or with rice, plantain and other foods, 978-978-56595-1-1, Efo is the traditional African wild spinach. Riro literally means ""to mix"" - so efo riro literally translates to a ""mixed spinach"" in Yoruba language! The traditional recipe for this Nigerian spinach stew typically uses goat meat (or a variety of meats) as well as stock fish and crayfish for umami., For the sake of everyone connected to this column, here are the names of spinach in the three major languages in Nigeria: Efo tete or Amunututu in Yoruba (literally, a cool appetizer to the stomach), Akwukwo nri in Ibo and Ganye alayyafo in Hausa."
